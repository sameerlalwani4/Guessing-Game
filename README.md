# Guessing-Game
Just a simple PHP file which will show:
1. Your guess is too low - if the number in the global variable is less than 18
2. Your guess is too high - if the number in the global variable is more than 18
3. Congratulations, You are right - if the number is equal to 18
4. Your guess is not a number - if you enter alphabets
5. Your guess is too short - if you don't enter any value
6. Missing guess parameter - if you don't enter the parameter
